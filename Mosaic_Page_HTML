		<h1>Computing Technologies at SETI@home</h1>
		<div id="content">
		<p>SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, is experiencing a severe lack of funding. Therefore, a volunteer initiative based in California called SETI@Home, where the user downloads the client software, was established in order to supplement the unefficiency of resources in SETI experiences. This largest distributed computing network in history utilizes even sporadically connected Internet devices and the BOINC software, published by the University of California, to donate your computer's idle time and the CPU's surplus energy toward the search for intelligent and interstellar life in the universe.</p>
		<p><img class="graphics" alt="Computer Crunching Data" src="Images/graphics.bmp"/>It is a captivating experience viewing the volatile graphics depicting the movements of rates and levels of patterns stemming from perhaps an extraterrestrial origin. The raw data sent from an observeratory in Puerto Rick which fills nearly 1GB of data every day is emailed to Berkeley University, where the data is divided into 250KB chunks. After the meticulous search of spikes or patterns in the data, SETI@Home.ca receives the gathered information and organizes it in a hierarchical directory structure in one of its various databases or informational archives.</p>
		<p>Many computer users use this software on old laptops or computers not being used, to donate CPU cycles. In addition, this program has a significant advantage as compared to many other programs that BOINC offers since it is open-source. This is an advantage as it is easier to modify for the programmers, enabling newer updates for its volunteers often.</p>
		<p>Therefore, while your computer is idle, it may contribute perhaps to mankind's greatest feat by downloading, processing and analyzing radio telescope data free of cost. To get involved in more assignments which also download and crunch packets of statistics, contemplate CERN's hunt for particles with green energy using BOINC.</p>
