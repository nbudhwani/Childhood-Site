# Childhood-Site
This repository contains 2 CSS scripts and 2 HTML scripts for a site I made in 2009 (Grade 9). 
It was graciously hosted by Mr. Arkin on his personal website touque.ca. 
Although the site has considerable design defects and a few spelling errors, it is saved in my repo as a testament to how far I've come on the winding road of computer science.
